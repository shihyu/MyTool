    </ul>
    <li><b>Sharing Your Configuration with Multiple Instances</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>By default, SlickEdit now supports running multiple instances which share one configuration directory. Be sure this feature is turned on by setting "Save configuration" to "Share config - Save configuration immediately" (Tools&gt;Options&gt;Application Options&gt;Exit). For example, if you start two instances of SlickEdit, change your edit window color profile, then switch to the other instance, you will notice that this configuration change is transferred. This sharing feature supports almost all configuration options (emulation, key bindings, theme, recorded macros, fonts, etc.). See "Limitations with sharing your configuration with multiple instances" in the on-line help for information on limitations.</li>
        <li>Use Project&lt;Organize All Workspace... to open a workspace in a new instances of SlickEdit.</li>
        <li>This makes it easy to launch two different instances of SlickEdit and open a different workspace in each. Use an additional instance of SlickEdit for a quick edit or use SlickEdit as the git comment editor. There's no need to maintain multiple configuration directories.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>New Interactive Tool Window</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Runs one or more interactive shells.</li>

        <li>Ctrl+Alt+Enter (or Ctrl+Command+Enter) Loads current line or selection into the associated interactive shell.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>New Terminal Tool Window</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Run one or more terminals in and edit window.</li>
        <li>Supports running build tools, grep tools (sgrep), and traversing the error messages with next-error and prev-error commands. Use cursor-error command (Alt+1 by default) to select the terminal or build window you want to process next-error and prev-error commands.</li>
        <li>Command completion is saved/restored across sessions.</li>
        <li>Activate the Terminal tool window with the active-terminal command.</li>
        <li>Bind the start-terminal-key command to a key to provide a quick way to start a terminal identified by that key.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>DIFFzilla</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>New simplified setup dialog</li>
        <li>Icons added in margin to copy blocks of text back and forth</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Version Control</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced Git support</li>

            </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Tagging</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Sub-word pattern matching for symbol completion and the Find Symbol tool window. This allows symbol completion to find symbols which match on subwords, for example, the pattern "house" might match symbols such as "HouseKeeping", "DogHouse", "GetHomeUserName", or "HotOmeletsUsingSummerEggs".</li>
        <li>New command line option "-autotag" to vsmktags for building compiler tag files for C/C++, Java, and .NET</li>
        <li>The tagging database can now store documentation comments gathered from source code. This makes displaying comments in the Preview tool window and with Function Argument help and List Members faster.</li>
        <li>Improved performance building large tag files using background tagging, especially when writing to slower devices.</li>
        <li>Gather performance statistics for parsing the current file for symbols and statements and use them to fine-tune how aggressive tagging tool windows should be when updating the current context, as well as to disable certain features which require statement tagging if you are working in a large file where performance could become laggy.</li>
        <li>Find Symbol tool window now has a stop button allowing you to stop long-running searches</li>
        <li>Find Symbol tool window now has separate columns for symbol name and the symbol's package/class scope</li>

    </ul>
    <li><b>Debugger</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Python debugger now uses PTVSD for backend</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Now supports conditions and counts for breakpoints</li>
           <li>Better handling for debugging with deep call stacks</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Toggle breakpoint command now supports multiple cursors</li>
        <li>Added options to display floating point numbers as scientific, floating point, or normal layout</li>
        <li>Increased precision when displaying double precision (64-bit) floating point numbers in the debugger</li>
        <li>Added optoins to display strings with UTF-8 characters natively, or using character escapes</li>
        <li>Fixed bug handling string which contained escape sequence with GDB</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Find and Replace</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Added "Find in Files threads" option for specifying number of threads used for multi-file searching.</li>
        <li>Increased default number of multi-file search threads from 3 to 8. This improves performance about 20% for a quad core i7 and about 100% for an i9 (assuming at least an SSD).</li>
        <li>The Find in Files filename output order is now listed in the same order as the file system. Previously filename output order was somewhat random.</li>
        <li>The "Sort Find in Files search results by filename" option now supports threaded searching after files are listed and sorted.</li>
        <li>Added encoding support to standalone sgrep. Defaults to AutoUnicode2.</li>
        <li>Added threaded searching to standalone sgrep. Defaults to 8 threads. Searching many times faster.</li>
        <li>Added color output support to standalone sgrep. Color is output by default when run in the SlickEdit build or terminal window. Also outputs color by default on Unix and macOS when outputting to a terminal when TERM set to "xterm-256-color".</li>
        <li>Added option for Preview All... on the Replace / Replace in Files tool window to display the modified file(s) on the left instead of the right.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug where Preview All... would not show scroll bar markup</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Appearance Enhancements</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated color toolbar icons</li>
        <li>Better support for macOS dark mode. For macOS, the default SlickEdit theme is "Automatic" theme which chooses SlickEdit's Dark theme if macOS is in Dark mode. The default SlickEdit color profile is "Automatic" which chooses the "Slate" color profile if macOS is in dark mode.</li>
        <li>When you right click on a tool window tab group / title bar to bring up the tool window menu, if you select a tool window to open, it will dock with the tab group you clicked on.</li>
        <li>The tool window menu now shows check marks for which tool windows are active, and there is a new option to toggle a tool window hidden when it is selected from the menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Files</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Rename File Support</b></li>
        <ul>

        <li>New edit style option added called "Show extra line after last newline" (off by default). When on and the last line of the file has a newline, an extra line is displayed. When on, newly created files will start with a single line that is not terminated with a newline. You may want to set def_select_all_line to 0 if you want the select-all command to create a CHAR selection to more closely emulation other products which display an extra line after the last newline.</li>
        <li>File completion on Unix (Linux) is now case insensitive by default. Those of you with mixed case filenames that also use the command line will really like this.</li>
        <li><b>Unix/Qt open dialog improvements</b></li>
