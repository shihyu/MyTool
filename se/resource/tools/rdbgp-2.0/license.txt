The Komodo Ruby debugger consists of client code wholly written by
ActiveState Software Inc. (ActiveState), which uses the ruby-debug
library.  The two parts of the code are licensed differently.

The ActiveState code consists of all files but the plain-text Ruby
file "ruby-debug-base.rb" and the binary file "ruby_debug.so".  The
ActiveState code is released under the non-GPL
alternative of the Ruby License, which can be found at:

    http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt

Below is a copy of that license made on 2004-07-30.
