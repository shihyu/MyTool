/**

 * classes that apply to the Slick-C editor control.

namespace sc.editor;

/**
 * This class is used to simplify using a temporary selection. When the 
 * TempSelection is constructed the current active selection is saved and a 
 * temporary selection is made active. Upon destruction the original active
 * selection is restored.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * There are 2 ways to use TempSelection:<br>
 *
 * <li>Managed. Temporary selection creation and lifetime managed 
 * automatically. This is the default. When the TempSelection object is 
 * constructed, the temporary selection is allocated and made active. Upon 
 * destruction (e.g. falling out of scope) the temporary selection is 
 * automatically freed. 
 *
 * <li>Unmanaged. Use this method when the temporary selection must persist 
 * beyond the lifetime of the TempSelection. When the TempSelection object 
 * is constructed, the temporary selection passed in is made active. Upon 
 * destruction (e.g. falling out of scope) the temporary selection is NOT 
 * freed. 
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Note:<br>
 * The active window does not have to be an editor control to save 
 * and restore the active selection, but the active window must be an
 * editor control to operate on selected text (e.g. {@link 
 * _select_line}, {@link _select_char}, {@link _select_block}, etc.).
 * 
 * @example
 * <pre>
 * void magicWordSelection() 
 * { 
 *    // Temporarily select the current word
 *    TempSelection sentry();
 *    select_whole_word();
 *    refresh();
 *    // Count to 3
 *    delay(300);
 *    
 *    // TempSelection sentry falls out of scope and automatically
 *    // restores original active selection. Temporary selection
 *    // is automatically destroyed.
 * } 
 * </pre>

    *                managed versus unmanaged temporary
    *                selections. Defaults to -1.
