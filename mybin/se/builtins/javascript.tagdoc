 * Evaluates a string of JavaScript code without reference to a particular object.
 * 
 * Syntax 
 * 
 * eval(string)
 * 
 * Parameters 
 * 
 * string   A string representing a JavaScript expression, statement, or 
 *          sequence of statements.  The expression can include variables and 
 *          properties of existing objects.  
 * 
 * eval is a top-level function and is not associated with any object.
 * 
 * The argument of the eval function is a string.  If the string represents 
 * an expression, eval evaluates the expression.  If the argument represents 
 * one or more JavaScript statements, eval performs the statements.  Do not 
 * call eval to evaluate an arithmetic expression; JavaScript evaluates 
 * arithmetic expressions automatically.  
 * 
 * If you construct an arithmetic expression as a string, you can use eval to 
 * evaluate it at a later time.  For example, suppose you have a variable x.  
 * You can postpone evaluation of an expression involving x by assigning the 
 * string value of the expression, say "3 * x + 2", to a variable, and then 
 * calling eval at a later point in your script.  
 * 
 * If the argument of eval is not a string, eval returns the argument 
 * unchanged.  In the following example, the String constructor is specified, 
 * and eval returns a String object rather than evaluating the string.  
 * 
 * eval(new String("2+2")) // returns a String object containing "2+2"eval("2+2")             // returns 4
 * You should not indirectly use the eval function by invoking it via a name 
 * other than eval.  For example, you should not use the following code: 
 * 
 * var x = 2var y = 4var myEval = evalmyEval("x + y")

    * Objects with a positive tabIndex are selected in increasing iIndex order 
    * and in source order to resolve duplicates.  
    * Objects with an tabIndex of zero are selected in source order.

    * For Internet Explorer 5.01 and later, set the TABINDEX attribute to any 
    * value.  
    * 
    * Content of elements with a closing tag can have focus by default, but are 
    * not tab stops.  As of Internet Explorer 5, you can set the tabIndex 
    * property to a valid positive integer to force the content to have a tab

    * 
    * An element can have focus if the tabIndex property is set to any valid

    * 
    * The following elements can have focus and are tab stops by default: a,

    * 
    * This method, and the following remarks, apply only to attached behaviors, 
    * which are the original Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behaviors introduced in 
    * Internet Explorer 5.  Element behaviors are a new feature in Internet 
    * Explorer 5.5 and cannot be added or removed from an element.

    * This method enables you to attach a behavior without using Cascading Style 
    * Sheets (CSS).  
    * 
    * Unless the behavior specified in the addBehavior call is one of the 
    * default behaviors built into Internet Explorer, the addBehavior call 
    * causes Internet Explorer to download the behavior asynchronously, before 
    * the behavior is attached to the element.  
    * 
    * Due to the asynchronous nature of the addBehavior method, its return value 
    * cannot be relied on to determine whether the behavior was successfully 
    * applied to the element.  Waiting for the onreadystatechange event to fire 
    * and verifying that the readyState property of the element is set to 
    * complete ensure that the behavior is completely attached to the element, 
    * and that all the behavior's members are available for scripting.  
    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the 
    * behavior is attached to the element results in a scripting error 
    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by 
    * applying the proposed CSS behavior attribute inline, is not automatically 
    * detached from the element when the element is removed from the document 
    * hierarchy.  However, a behavior attached using a style rule defined in the

    * If the property or attribute specified by the first parameter requires a 
    * string, the data type of the second parameter must be a string.  
    * Otherwise, the second parameter is evaluated prior to invoking 
    * setExpression, causing the expression to be set to the result of the 
    * evaluation.  
    * 
    * Use the uniqueID property of an object in an expression to refer back to 
    * the object.  Using uniqueID is an alternative to specifying an id for 
    * expressions that use an object reference.  
    * 
    * The cssText property is a unique property that is not compatible with the

    *       link  Link cursor is displayed.

    *             displayed.  
    * 
    * The property is read/write.  The property has a default value of none.  
    * 
    * For dropEffect to work, it must be used with the effectAllowed property.  
    * These properties are set on the source object of a drag-and-drop 
    * operation.  The effectAllowed property determines which drag-and-drop 
    * operations are available from the source object.  The dropEffect property 
    * determines which drag-and-drop operations are allowed on the target 
    * object.  For example, the source object might set the effectAllowed 
    * property to all drag-and-drop operations, while the target object 
    * specifies that the dropEffect allows only copy operations.  
    * 
    * The recommended technique for dropping text is to set the dropEffect in 
    * the target object's event handler function for the following events: 
    * ondragenter, ondragover, and ondrop.  The effectAllowed property must be 
    * set in one of the source object's drag-and-drop event handlers, such as 
    * the ondragstart event.  
    * 
    * The target object of a drag-and-drop operation can set the dropEffect 
    * during the ondragenter, ondragover, and ondrop events.  To display the 
    * desired cursor until the final drop, the default action of the 
    * ondragenter, ondragover, and ondrop events must be canceled and the 
    * dropEffect must be set.  Otherwise, the copy cursor, move cursor, or link 
    * cursor set by this property displays only until the first valid drop 
    * target is intersected, at which point the cursor is replaced by the 
    * drop/no-drop cursor for the rest of the drag operation.  
    * 
    * Microsoft Internet Explorer delivers default drag-and-drop functionality 
    * for a, img, textArea, and input type=text.  When one of these objects is

    * All the pages on different hosts must have the domain property explicitly set to the same value to

    * 
    * bContainerCapture Optional.  Boolean that specifies one of the following values: 
    *          true     Default.  Events originating within a container are captured 
    *                   by the container.  
    *          false    Events originating within a container are not captured by the 
    *                   container.  
    *  
    * Once mouse capture is set to an object, that object fires all mouse events 
    * for the document.  Supported mouse events include onmousedown, onmouseup, 
    * onmousemove, onclick, ondblclick, onmouseover, and onmouseout.  The 
    * srcElement property of the window event object always returns the object

    * capture.  
    * 
    * When a container object, such as a div, has mouse capture, events 
    * originating on objects within that container are fired by the div, unless 
    * the bContainerCapture parameter of the setCapture method is set to false.  
    * Passing the value false causes the container to no longer capture all 
    * document events.  Instead, objects within that container still fire 
    * events, and those events also bubble as expected.  
    * 
    * Drag-and-drop as well as text selection through the user interface are 
    * disabled when mouse capture is set programmatically.  
    * 
    * The following key events are unaffected by mouse capture and fire as 
    * usual: onkeydown, onkeyup, and onkeypress.

    *                      VBScript    Language is VBScript.

    * The data type of the evaluated expression in the sLanguage parameter must 
    * match one of the possible values allowed for the sExpression parameter.  
    * If the property or attribute specified by the first parameter requires a 
    * string, the data type of the second parameter must be a string.  
    * Otherwise, the second parameter is evaluated prior to invoking 
    * setExpression, causing the expression to be set to the result of the 
    * evaluation.  
    * 
    * Use the uniqueID property of an object in an expression to refer back to 
    * the object.  Using uniqueID is an alternative to specifying an id for 
    * expressions that use an object reference.  
    * 
    * The cssText property is a unique property that is not compatible with the 
    * dynamic properties implementation.  Do not use cssText with any dynamic

    * but may not be.

    * 
    * This method, and the following remarks, apply only to attached behaviors,

    * Internet Explorer 5.  Element behaviors are a new feature in Internet

    * the behavior is attached to the element.  
    * 
    * Due to the asynchronous nature of the addBehavior method, its return value

    * and verifying that the readyState property of the element is set to 
    * complete ensure that the behavior is completely attached to the element, 
    * and that all the behavior's members are available for scripting.  
    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the 
    * behavior is attached to the element results in a scripting error 
    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by 
    * applying the proposed CSS behavior attribute inline, is not automatically 
    * detached from the element when the element is removed from the document 
    * hierarchy.  However, a behavior attached using a style rule defined in the

    * If the height property of an img is specified, but the width property is 
    * not specified, the resulting width of the img is sized proportionally 
    * according to the specified height property and the actual width (in 
    * pixels) of the image in the source file.  
    * 
    * Consider the following: Dimensions of image in source file (pixels): 100 X 
    * 50 (W X H) 
    * Specified image height: 2in 
    * Specified image width: not specified 
    * Resulting image height: 2in 
    * Resulting image width: 4in ((100 / 50) * 2 inches) 
    * 
    * If you specify the height property of an img, and the height and width of 
    * the image in the source file are identical, the width of the image matches 
    * the height.  
    * 
    * If you specify the height property and the width property of an img, the 
    * resulting image dimensions matches those specified.  
    * 
    * Percentage values are based on the height of the parent object.  
    * 
    * When scripting the height property, use either the pixelHeight or 
    * posHeight property to numerically manipulate the height value.  
    * 
    * If dynamic changes are intended for the height and width, the original 
    * values should be set through style (e.g.  "style=''height:200px; 
    * width:200px'') rather than through the height and width attributes.  
    * 
    * This property specifies the calculated height of the object, in pixels.  
    * For table rows and table cells, this property has a range of 0 to 32750 
    * pixels.  
    * 
    * If you set the value of the corresponding HTML attribute using a 
    * percentage, this property specifies the height, in pixels, represented by 
    * that percentage.  
    * 
    * The scripting property is read/write for the img object, but read-only for 
    * other objects.

    * string, the data type of the second parameter must be a string.  
    * Otherwise, the second parameter is evaluated prior to invoking 
    * setExpression, causing the expression to be set to the result of the 
    * evaluation.  
    * 
    * Use the uniqueID property of an object in an expression to refer back to 
    * the object.  Using uniqueID is an alternative to specifying an id for

    *                   If this parameter is an integer, the method returns the element in the collection 
    *                   at the given position, where the first element has value 0, the second has 1,

    * The all collection includes one element object for each valid HTML tag. If a valid tag has a matching

    * HEAD, and TITLE objects regardless of whether the tags are present in the document. If the BODY tag 
    * is not present, but other HTML tags are, a BODY object is added to the all collection.
    * 
    * If the document contains invalid or unknown tags, the collection includes one element object for 
    * each. Unlike valid end tags, unknown end tags are represented by their own element objects. The 
    * order of the element objects is the HTML source order. Although the collection indicates the order 
    * of tags, it does not indicate hierarchy.
    * 
    * The name property only applies to some elements such as form elements. If the vIndex is set to a 
    * string matching the value of a name property in an element that the name property does not apply, 
    * then that element will not be added to the collection.

    * 
    * This method, and the following remarks, apply only to attached behaviors, 
    * which are the original Dynamic HTML (DHTML) behaviors introduced in 
    * Internet Explorer 5.  Element behaviors are a new feature in Internet 
    * Explorer 5.5 and cannot be added or removed from an element.

    * Sheets (CSS).  
    * 
    * Unless the behavior specified in the addBehavior call is one of the

    * and that all the behavior's members are available for scripting.  
    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the 
    * behavior is attached to the element results in a scripting error 
    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by 
    * applying the proposed CSS behavior attribute inline, is not automatically 
    * detached from the element when the element is removed from the document 
    * hierarchy.  However, a behavior attached using a style rule defined in the

    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the

    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.

    * musicStyle contains three options, you can access these options as 
    * musicStyle.options[0], musicStyle.options[1], and musicStyle.options[2].  
    * 
    * To obtain the number of options in the selection list, you can use either 
    * Select.length or the length property of the options array.  For example, 
    * you can get the number of options in the musicStyle selection list with 
    * either of these expressions: 
    * musicStyle.lengthmusicStyle.options.length 
    * You can add or remove options from a selection list using this array.  To 
    * add or replace an option to an existing Select object, you assign a new 
    * Option object to a place in the array.  For example, to create a new 
    * Option object called jeans and add it to the end of the selection list 
    * named myList, you could use the following code: 
    * jeans = new Option("Blue Jeans", "jeans", false, 
    * false);myList.options[myList.length] = jeans; 
    * To delete an option from a Select object, you set the appropriate index of 
    * the options array to null.  Removing an option compresses the options 
    * array.  For example, assume that myList has 5 elements in it, the value of 
    * the fourth element is "foo", and you execute this statement: 
    * myList.options[1] = null 
    * Now, myList has 4 elements in it and the value of the third element is 
    * "foo".  
    * 
    * After you delete an option, you must refresh the document by using 
    * history.go(0).  This statement must be last.  When the document reloads, 
    * variables are lost if not saved in cookies or form element values.  
    * 
    * You can determine which option in a selection list is currently selected 
    * by using either the selectedIndex property of the options array or of the 
    * Select object itself.  That is, the following expressions return the same 
    * value: 
    * musicStyle.selectedIndexmusicStyle.options.selectedIndex 
    * For more information about this property, see Select.selectedIndex.  
    * 
    * For Select objects that can have multiple selections (that is, the SELECT 
    * tag has the MULTIPLE attribute), the selectedIndex property is not very 
    * useful.  In this case, it returns the index of the first selection.  To 
    * find all the selected options, you have to loop and test each option 
    * individually.  For example, to print a list of all selected options in a 
    * selection list named mySelect, you could use code such as this: 
    * document.write("You've selected the following options:\n")for (var i = 0; 
    * i < mySelect.options.length; i++) { if (mySelect.options[i].selected) 
    * document.write(" mySelect.options[i].text\n")} 
    * In general, to work with individual options in a selection list, you work 
    * with the appropriate Option object.

    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the 
    * behavior is attached to the element results in a scripting error 
    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by

    * An array corresponding to options in a Select object in source 
    * order.
    * 
    * You can refer to the options of a Select object by using the options 
    * array.  This array contains an entry for each option in a Select object 
    * (OPTION tag) in source order.  For example, if a Select object named 
    * musicStyle contains three options, you can access these options as 
    * musicStyle.options[0], musicStyle.options[1], and musicStyle.options[2].  
    * 
    * To obtain the number of options in the selection list, you can use either 
    * Select.length or the length property of the options array.  For example, 
    * you can get the number of options in the musicStyle selection list with 
    * either of these expressions: 
    * musicStyle.lengthmusicStyle.options.length 
    * You can add or remove options from a selection list using this array.  To 
    * add or replace an option to an existing Select object, you assign a new 
    * Option object to a place in the array.  For example, to create a new 
    * Option object called jeans and add it to the end of the selection list 
    * named myList, you could use the following code: 
    * jeans = new Option("Blue Jeans", "jeans", false, 
    * false);myList.options[myList.length] = jeans; 
    * To delete an option from a Select object, you set the appropriate index of 
    * the options array to null.  Removing an option compresses the options 
    * array.  For example, assume that myList has 5 elements in it, the value of 
    * the fourth element is "foo", and you execute this statement: 
    * myList.options[1] = null 
    * Now, myList has 4 elements in it and the value of the third element is 
    * "foo".  
    * 
    * After you delete an option, you must refresh the document by using 
    * history.go(0).  This statement must be last.  When the document reloads, 
    * variables are lost if not saved in cookies or form element values.  
    * 
    * You can determine which option in a selection list is currently selected 
    * by using either the selectedIndex property of the options array or of the 
    * Select object itself.  That is, the following expressions return the same 
    * value: 
    * musicStyle.selectedIndexmusicStyle.options.selectedIndex 
    * For more information about this property, see Select.selectedIndex.  
    * 
    * For Select objects that can have multiple selections (that is, the SELECT 
    * tag has the MULTIPLE attribute), the selectedIndex property is not very 
    * useful.  In this case, it returns the index of the first selection.  To 
    * find all the selected options, you have to loop and test each option 
    * individually.  For example, to print a list of all selected options in a 
    * selection list named mySelect, you could use code such as this: 
    * document.write("You've selected the following options:\n")for (var i = 0; 
    * i < mySelect.options.length; i++) { if (mySelect.options[i].selected) 
    * document.write(" mySelect.options[i].text\n")}

    * 
    * This method, and the following remarks, apply only to attached behaviors,

    * Internet Explorer 5.  Element behaviors are a new feature in Internet 
    * Explorer 5.5 and cannot be added or removed from an element.

    * 
    * Unless the behavior specified in the addBehavior call is one of the

    * 
    * Due to the asynchronous nature of the addBehavior method, its return value

    * and verifying that the readyState property of the element is set to 
    * complete ensure that the behavior is completely attached to the element, 
    * and that all the behavior's members are available for scripting.  
    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the 
    * behavior is attached to the element results in a scripting error 
    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by 
    * applying the proposed CSS behavior attribute inline, is not automatically 
    * detached from the element when the element is removed from the document 
    * hierarchy.  However, a behavior attached using a style rule defined in the

    * This method, and the following remarks, apply only to attached behaviors,

    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.

    * Use the setExpression method to add expressions to supported Cascading 
    * Style Sheets (CSS) attributes and read/write DHTML Properties.  To remove 
    * expressions set by setExpression, use the removeExpression method.  
    * 
    * The following syntax sections show how to set an expression on DHTML 
    * Properties and CSS attributes.  
    * 
    * Use this syntax to set an expression on a read/write property or on an 
    * expando property.  
    * object.setExpression(sPropertyName, sExpression, sLanguage) 
    * Use this syntax to set an expression on a CSS attribute.  
    * object.style.setExpression(sPropertyName, sExpression, sLanguage) 
    * Use the expression() syntax to set an expression on a CSS attribute in 
    * HTML.  
    * <ELEMENT STYLE="sAttributeName:expression(sExpression)"> 
    * 
    * The data type of the evaluated expression in the sLanguage parameter must 
    * match one of the possible values allowed for the sExpression parameter.  
    * If the property or attribute specified by the first parameter requires a 
    * string, the data type of the second parameter must be a string.  
    * Otherwise, the second parameter is evaluated prior to invoking 
    * setExpression, causing the expression to be set to the result of the 
    * evaluation.  
    * 
    * Use the uniqueID property of an object in an expression to refer back to 
    * the object.  Using uniqueID is an alternative to specifying an id for 
    * expressions that use an object reference.  
    * 
    * The cssText property is a unique property that is not compatible with the 
    * dynamic properties implementation.  Do not use cssText with any dynamic 
    * property methods.  
    * 
    * The following examples illustrate common problems encountered with the 
    * sExpression parameter in setExpression.  The sExpression appears valid, 
    * but may not be.  
    * 
    * The provided sExpression is invalid because document.style.fontSize is 
    * "npx" and will not add to 13 
    * object.style.setExpression("height","document.style.fontSize + 13"); 
    * The provided sExpression is invalid when document.body.style.fontSize is 
    * previously unspecified 
    * object.style.setExpression("width","document.body.style.fontSize");

    * Otherwise, attempting to use any behavior-defined member before the

    * indicating that the object does not support that particular member.  
    * 
    * Note A behavior attached to an element using the addBehavior method, or by 
    * applying the proposed CSS behavior attribute inline, is not automatically

    * 
    * If you insert a row in a tFoot, tBody, or tHead, you also need to add the

    * table, you also need to add the row to the rows collection for the tBody.  
    * If you specify an index, the index should be relative to the rows 
    * collection for the element that first contains the tr.  For example, if 
    * you call this method for a tBody, you must specify an index value relative 
    * to the rows collection that is on the tBody, not the table.  
    * 
    * The preferred technique for inserting a row is to add the row at the end 
    * of the rows collection.  It is faster to add a row at the end of a table 
    * than somewhere in the middle.  To add a row at the end of the collection, 
    * specify the -1 value, or the length of the rows collection minus 1.

    * Remarks 
    * 
    * A range has two distinct states: degenerate and nondegenerate.  
    * 
    * A degenerate range is like a text editor caret (insertion point) it does

    * two characters.  The end points of a degenerate range are adjacent.

    * A nondegenerate range is like a text editor selection, in that it selects 
    * a certain amount of text.  The end points of a nondegenerate range are not 
    * adjacent.  
    * 
    * The value passed for the iSearchScope parameter controls the part of the 
    * document, relative to the range, that is searched.  The behavior of the 
    * findText method depends on whether the state is degenerate or 
    * nondegenerate: 
    * 
    * If the range is degenerate, passing a large positive number causes the 
    * text to the right of the range to be searched.  Passing a large negative 
    * number causes the text to the left of the range to be searched.  
    * If the range is nondegenerate, passing a large positive number causes the 
    * text to the right of the start of the range to be searched.  Passing a 
    * large negative number causes the text to the left of the end of the range 
    * to be searched.  Passing 0 causes only the text selected by the range to 
    * be searched.  
    * 
    * This feature might not be available on non-Microsoft Win32 platforms.

    * implementation of title in the sFeatures parameter of the open method.  
    * Turn off the title bar by opening the window from a trusted application,

    *
    * In event handlers, you must specify window.open() instead of simply using 
    * open().  Due to the scoping of static objects in JavaScript, a call to 
    * open() without specifying an object name is equivalent to document.open().  
    * 
    * The open method opens a new Web browser window on the client, similar to 
    * choosing New, then Navigator Window from the Navigator File menu.  The URL 
    * argument specifies the URL contained by the new window.  If URL is an 
    * empty string, a new, empty window is created.  
    * 
    * You can use open on an existing window, and if you pass the empty string 
    * for the URL, you will get a reference to the existing window, but not load 
    * anything into it.  You can, for example, then look for properties in the 
    * window.  
    * 
    * windowFeatures is an optional string containing a comma-separated list of 
    * options for the new window (do not include any spaces in this list).

    *
    * alwaysLowered     (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates a new window that floats below other 
    *                   windows, whether it is active or not.  This is a secure feature and must 
    *                   be set in signed scripts.  
    *
    * alwaysRaised      (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates a new window that floats on top of other 
    *                   windows, whether it is active or not.  This is a secure feature and must 
    *                   be set in signed scripts.  
    *
    * dependent         (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates a new window as a child of the current 
    *                   window.  A dependent window closes when its parent window closes.  On 
    *                   Windows platforms, a dependent window does not show on the task bar.  
    *  
    * directories       If yes, creates the standard browser directory buttons, such as What's New and What's Cool.
    *  
    * height            (JavaScript 1.0 and 1.1) Specifies the height of the window in pixels.
    *  
    * hotkeys           (JavaScript 1.2) If no (or 0), disables most hotkeys in a new window that 
    *                   has no menu bar.  The security and quit hotkeys remain enabled.  
    * innerHeight       (JavaScript 1.2) Specifies the height, in pixels, of the window's content area. 
    *                   To create a window smaller than 100 x 100 pixels, set this feature in a signed 
    *                   script. This feature replaces height, which remains for backwards compatibility. 
    *  
    * innerWidth        (JavaScript 1.2) Specifies the width, in pixels, of the window's content 
    *                   area.  To create a window smaller than 100 x 100 pixels, set this feature 
    *                   in a signed script.  This feature replaces width, which remains for 
    *                   backwards compatibility.  
    * location          If yes, creates a Location entry field.
    *  
    * menubar           If yes, creates the menu at the top of the window.
    *  
    * outerHeight       (JavaScript 1.2) Specifies the vertical dimension, in pixels, of the 
    *                   outside boundary of the window.  To create a window smaller than 100 x 100 
    *                   pixels, set this feature in a signed script.  
    *  
    * personalbar       (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates the Personal Toolbar, which displays 
    *                   buttons from the user's Personal Toolbar bookmark folder.  
    *  
    * resizable         If yes, allows a user to resize the window.
    *  
    * screenX           (JavaScript 1.2) Specifies the distance the new window is placed from the 
    *                   left side of the screen.  To place a window offscreen, set this feature in 
    *                   a signed scripts.  
    *  
    * screenY           (JavaScript 1.2) Specifies the distance the new window is placed from the 
    *                   top of the screen.  To place a window offscreen, set this feature in a 
    *                   signed scripts.  
    *  
    * scrollbars        If yes, creates horizontal and vertical scrollbars when the Document grows 
    *                   larger than the window dimensions.  
    *  
    * status            If yes, creates the status bar at the bottom of the window.
    *  
    * titlebar          (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates a window with a title bar.  To set the 
    *                   titlebar to no, set this feature in a signed script.  
    *  
    * toolbar           If yes, creates the standard browser toolbar, with buttons such as Back and Forward.
    *  
    * width             (JavaScript 1.0 and 1.1) Specifies the width of the window in pixels. 
    *  
    * z-lock            (JavaScript 1.2) If yes, creates a new window that does not rise above 
    *                   other windows when activated.  This is a secure feature and must be set in 
    *                   signed scripts.  
    *

    * these features, you can use 1 instead of yes and 0 instead of no.  If you 
    * want to turn a feature on, you can also simply list the feature name in

    *                                        inactive states, the surrounding HTML elements dynamically reflow within 
    *                                        the page.

    *                                        timeline is active, and makes the element disappear when the timeline is 
    *                                        inactive.  The surrounding HTML elements do not reflow as a result of the 
    *                                        local element changing between active and inactive states.  
    *

    * The default value of the timeAction property depends on the element using 
    * it.  When it is used on the t:SEQ element, the default value is display.  
    * For all other elements, the default value is visibility.  
    * 
    * If you specify a CLASS attribute for the timeAction property that is 
    * already present on the element, that class will be removed whenever the 
    * element is not active on the timeline.  In the following example, the 
    * redText class is applied only while the span is active on the timeline; 
    * however, the boldFont class is always applied to the span.  
    * 
    * <SPAN CLASS="redText boldFont" STYLE="behavior:url(#default#time2)" 
    * BEGIN="5" TIMEACTION="class:redText">The text is red 
    * only while this element is active on the timeline.  
    * </SPAN> 
    * 
    * To specify multiple classes for the timeAction property, separate the 
    * class names with white space.  
    * 
    * If the display attribute is set to none through persistence or before the 
    * time2 behavior is dynamically added, the element will not display.  
    * 
    * If the visibility attribute is set to hidden through persistence or before 
    * the time2 behavior is dynamically added, the element will not display.  
    * 
    * If the HTML+TIME (Timed Interactive Multimedia Extensions) behavior is 
    * applied directly to the A element, by default, the element is always

<P>Provides access to the remote script process.</P>
<H4 class="dtH4">Remarks</H4>
<P>The <B>WshRemote</B> object allows you to remotely administer computer systems on a computer network. It represents an instance of a WSH script, i.e., a script file with one of the following extensions: .wsh, .wsf, .js, .vbs, .jse, .vbe, and so on. An instance of a running script is a process. You can run the process either on the local machine or on a remote machine. If you do not provide a network path, it will run locally. When a <B>WSHRemote </B>object is created (by using the <B>CreateScript() </B>method), the script is copied to the target computer system. Once there, the script does not begin executing immediately; it begins executing only when the <B>WSHRemote </B>method <B>Execute </B>is invoked. Through the <B>WshRemote</B> object interface, your script can manipulate other programs or scripts. Additionally, external applications can also manipulate remote scripts. The <B>WshRemote </B>object works asynchronously over DCOM.</P>

If the connection fails, an error is thrown. In Windows 9x/Me, the printer driver must already be installed on the machine for the <B>AddWindowsPrinterConnection</B> method to work. If the driver is not installed, Windows returns an error message.</P>

</DL>
<H4 class="dtH4">Remarks</H4>
<P>Use the <B>SendKeys </B>method to send keystrokes to applications that have no automation interface. Most keyboard characters are represented by a single keystroke. Some keyboard characters are made up of combinations of keystrokes (CTRL+SHIFT+HOME, for example). To send a single keyboard character, send the character itself as the <I>string</I> argument. For example, to send the letter x, send the <I>string</I> argument "x".</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To send a space, send the string " ".</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can use <B>SendKeys </B>to send more than one keystroke at a time. To do this, create a compound string argument that represents a sequence of keystrokes by appending each keystroke in the sequence to the one before it. For example, to send the keystrokes a, b, and c, you would send the string argument "abc". The <B>SendKeys </B>method uses some characters as modifiers of characters (instead of using their face-values). This set of special characters consists of parentheses, brackets, braces, and the:
<UL type="disc">
   <LI>plus sign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"+",</li>
   <LI>caret&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"^",</li>
   <LI>percent sign "%",</li>
   <LI>and tilde&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"~" </li>
</UL>
<P>Send these characters by enclosing them within braces "{}". For example, to send the plus sign, send the string argument "{+}". Brackets "[ ]" have no special meaning when used with <B>SendKeys</B>, but you must enclose them within braces to accommodate applications that do give them a special meaning (for dynamic data exchange (DDE) for example).
<UL type="disc">
   <LI>To send bracket characters, send the string argument "{[}" for the left bracket and "{]}" for the right one.</li>
   <LI>To send brace characters, send the string argument "{{}" for the left brace and "{}}" for the right one.</li>
</UL>
<P>Some keystrokes do not generate characters (such as ENTER and TAB). Some keystrokes represent actions (such as BACKSPACE and BREAK). To send these kinds of keystrokes, send the arguments shown in the following table:</P>

<P>To send keyboard characters that are comprised of a regular keystroke in combination with a SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT, create a compound string argument that represents the keystroke combination. You do this by preceding the regular keystroke with one or more of the following special characters:</P>
<div class="tablediv"><table cellspacing="0" class="dtTABLE">

</table></div>
<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<B><b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When used this way, these special characters are not enclosed within a set of braces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To specify that a combination of SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT should be held down while several other keys are pressed, create a compound string argument with the modified keystrokes enclosed in parentheses. For example, to send the keystroke combination that specifies that the SHIFT key is held down while:
<UL type="disc">
   <LI>e and c are pressed, send the string argument "+(ec)".</li>
   <LI>e is pressed, followed by a lone c (with no SHIFT), send the string argument "+ec".</li>
</UL>
<P>You can use the <B>SendKeys</B> method to send a pattern of keystrokes that consists of a single keystroke pressed several times in a row. To do this, create a compound string argument that specifies the keystroke you want to repeat, followed by the number of times you want it repeated. You do this using a compound string argument of the form {<I>keystroke number</I>}. For example, to send the letter "x" ten times, you would send the string argument "{x 10}". Be sure to include a space between keystroke and number.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<B><b class="le">Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The only keystroke pattern you can send is the kind that is comprised of a single keystroke pressed several times. For example, you can send "x" ten times, but you cannot do the same for "Ctrl+x".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4 class="dtH4">Remarks</H4>
<P>Objects created with the <B>CreateObject</B> method using the <I>strPrefix </I>argument are connected objects. These are useful when you want to sync an object's events. The object's outgoing interface is connected to the script file after the object is created. Event functions are a combination of this prefix and the event name. If you create an object and do not supply the <I>strPrefix </I>argument, you can still sync events on the object by using the <B>ConnectObject </B>method. When the object fires an event, WSH calls a subroutine with <I>strPrefix </I>attached to the beginning of the event name. For example, if <I>strPrefix</I> is <I>MYOBJ</I> and the object fires an event named <I>OnBegin</I>, Windows Script Host calls the <I>MYOBJ_OnBegin </I>subroutine located in the script. The <B>CreateObject</B> method returns a pointer to the object's IDispatch interface.</P>
<H4 class="dtH4">Example</H4>
<P>The following VBScript code uses the <B>CreateObject</B> method to create a <B>WshNetwork</B> object:</P>

</DL>
<H4 class="dtH4">Remarks</H4>
<P>Use the <B>GetObject</B> method when an instance of the object exists in memory, or when you want to create the object from a file. If no current instance exists and you do not want the object created from a file, use the <B>CreateObject</B> method. The <B>GetObject</B> method can be used with all COM classes, independent of the language used to create the object. If you supply the <I>strPrefix</I> argument, WSH connects the object's outgoing interface to the script file after creating the object. When the object fires an event, WSH calls a subroutine with <I>strPrefix </I>attached to the beginning of the event name. For example, if <I>strPrefix </I>is <code class="ce">MYOBJ_ </code>and the object fires an event named <code class="ce">OnBegin</code>, WSH calls the <code class="ce">MYOBJ_OnBegin </code>subroutine located in the script.</P>
<P>If an object is registered as a single-instance object, only one instance of the object is created (regardless of how many times <B>GetObject</B> is executed). The <B>GetObject</B> method always returns the same instance when called with the zero-length string syntax (""), and it causes an error if you do not supply the path parameter. You cannot use the <B>GetObject</B> method to obtain a reference to a Microsoft Visual Basic class created with Visual Basic 4.0 or earlier.</P>
<H4 class="dtH4">Example</H4>

MyApp = MyObject.Application</PRE>
<P>Some applications allow you to activate part of a file. To do this, add an exclamation mark (!) to the end of the file name, and follow it with a string that identifies the part of the file you want to activate. For example, in a drawing application, a drawing stored in a file might have multiple layers. The following code activates a layer within a drawing file called <code class="ce">SCHEMA.CAD</code>:</P>
