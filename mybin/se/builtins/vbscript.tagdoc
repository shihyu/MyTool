 * <DL>
 * <DT><B>ActiveX control</B>
 * <DD>An object that you place on a form to enable or enhance a user's
 * interaction with an application.  ActiveX controls have events and can be
 * incorporated into other controls.  The controls have an .ocx file name
 * extension.
 *
 * <DT><B>ActiveX object</B>
 * <DD>An object that is exposed to other applications or programming tools
 * through Automation interfaces.
 *
 * <DT><B>argument</B>
 * <DD>A constant, variable, or expression passed to a procedure.
 *
 * <DT><B>array</B>
 * <DD>A set of sequentially indexed elements having the same type of data.
 * Each element of an array has a unique identifying index number.  Changes
 * made to one element of an array do not affect the other elements.
 *
 * <DT><B>ASCII Character Set</B>
 * <DD>American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) 7-bit
 * character set widely used to represent letters and symbols found on a
 * standard U.S.  keyboard.  The ASCII character set is the same as the first
 * 128 characters (0&#150;127) in the ANSI character set.
 *
 * <DT><B>Automation object</B>
 * <DD>An object that is exposed to other applications or programming tools
 * through Automation interfaces.

 * <DT><B>Boolean expression</B>
 * <DD>An expression that evaluates to either <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.
 *
 * <DT><B>by reference</B>
 * <DD>A way of passing the address, rather than the value, of an argument
 * to a procedure.  This allows the procedure to access the actual variable.
 * As a result, the variable's actual value can be changed by the procedure
 * to which it is passed.
 *
 * <DT><B>by value</B>
 * <DD>A way of passing the value, rather than the address, of an argument
 * to a procedure.  This allows the procedure to access a copy of the

 * the procedure to which it is passed.
 *
 * <DT><B>character code</B>
 * <DD>A number that represents a particular character in a set, such as
 * the ASCII character set.
 *
 * <DT><B>class</B>
 * <DD>The formal definition of an object.  The class acts as the template
 * from which an instance of an object is created at run time.  The class
 * defines the properties of the object and the methods used to control the
 * object's behavior.
 *
 * <DT><B>class module</B>
 * <DD>A module containing the definition of a class (its property and method
 * definitions).
 *
 * <DT><B>collection</B>
 * <DD>An object that contains a set of related objects.  An object's
 * position in the collection can change whenever a change occurs in the
 * collection; therefore, the position of any specific object in the
 * collection may vary.
 *
 * <DT><B>comment</B>
 * <DD>Text added to code by a programmer that explains how the code works.

 * <DD>A character or symbol indicating a relationship between two or more
 * values or expressions.  These operators include less than (&lt;), less
 * than or equal to (&lt;=), greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to
 * (&gt;=), not equal (&lt;&gt;), and equal (=).  <p><b>Is</b> is also a
 * comparison operator, but it is used exclusively for determining if one
 * object reference is the same as another.
 *
 * <DT><B>constant</B>
 * <DD>A named item that retains a constant value throughout the execution
 * of a program.  Constants can be used anywhere in your code in place of
 * actual values.  A constant can be a string or numeric literal, another
 * constant, or any combination that includes arithmetic or logical operators

 *
 * <DT><B>date expression</B>
 * <DD>Any expression that can be interpreted as a date.  This includes any
 * combination of date literals, numbers that look like dates, strings that
 * look like dates, and dates returned from functions.  A date expression is
 * limited to numbers or strings, in any combination, that can represent a
 * date from January 1, 100 through December 31, 9999.
 * <P>Dates are stored as part of a real number.  Values to the left of the
 * decimal represent the date; values to the right of the decimal represent
 * the time.  Negative numbers represent dates prior to December 30,
 * 1899.
 *
 * <DT><B>date literal</B>
 * <DD>Any sequence of characters with a valid format that is surrounded by
 * number signs (#).  Valid formats include the date format specified by the
 * locale settings for your code or the universal date format.  For example,
 * #12/31/99# is the date literal that represents December 31, 1999, where
 * English-U.S.  is the locale setting for your application.
 * <P>In VBScript, the only recognized format is US-ENGLISH, regardless of
 * the actual locale of the user.  That is, the interpreted format is

 * with the <b>Name</b> property of the <b>Err</b> object, this number
 * represents a particular error message.
 *
 * <DT><B>expression</B>
 * <DD>A combination of keywords, operators, variables, and constants that
 * yield a string, number, or object.  An expression can perform a
 * calculation, manipulate characters, or test data.
 *
 * <DT><B>intrinsic constant</B>
 * <DD>A constant provided by an application.  Because you can't disable
 * intrinsic constants, you can't create a user-defined constant with the
 * same name.

 * example, a statement, function name, or operator.
 *
 * <DT><B>locale</B>
 * <DD>The set of information that corresponds to a given language and
 * country.  A locale affects the language of predefined programming terms
 * and locale-specific settings.  There are two contexts where locale
 * information is important:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The code locale affects the language of terms such as keywords and
 * defines locale-specific settings such as the decimal and list separators,
 * date formats, and character sorting order.
 * <LI>The system locale affects the way locale-aware functionality
 * behaves, for example, when you display numbers or convert strings to
 * dates.  You set the system locale using the Control Panel utilities

 *
 * <DT><B>object type</B>
 * <DD>A type of object exposed by an application, for example,
 * Application, File, Range, and Sheet.  Refer to the application's
 * documentation (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Word, and so
 * on) for a complete listing of available objects.
 *
 * <DT><B>pi</B>
 * <DD>Pi is a mathematical constant equal to approximately 3.1415926535897932.

 * <DT><B>Private</B>
 * <DD>Variables that are visible only to the script in which they are declared.
 *
 * <DT><B>procedure</B>
 * <DD>A named sequence of statements executed as a unit.  For example,
 * <b>Function</b> and <b>Sub</b> are types of procedures.
 *
 * <DT><B>procedure level</B>
 * <DD>Describes statements located within a <b>Function</b> or <b>Sub</b>
 * procedure.  Declarations are usually listed first, followed by assignments
 * and other executable code.  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
 * Sub MySub() ' This statement declares a sub procedure block.
 *     Dim A ' This statement starts the procedure block.
 *     A = &quot;My variable&quot; ' Procedure-level code.

 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>Note that script-level code resides outside any procedure blocks.
 *
 * <DT><B>property</B>
 * <DD>A named attribute of an object.  Properties define object
 * characteristics such as size, color, and screen location, or the state of
 * an object, such as enabled or disabled.</DD><P>

 * <DD>Variables declared using the <b>Public</b> Statement are visible to
 * all procedures in all modules in all applications.</DD><P>
 *
 * <DT><B>run time</B>
 * <DD>The time when code is running. During run time, you can't
 * edit the code.
 *
 * <DT><B>run-time error</B>
 * <DD>An error that occurs when code is running.  A run-time error results
 * when a statement attempts an invalid operation.
 *
 * <DT><B>scope</B>
 * <DD>Defines the visibility of a variable, procedure, or object.  For
 * example, a variable declared as <b>Public</b> is visible to all procedures
 * in all modules.  Variables declared in procedures are visible only within
 * the procedure and lose their value between calls.

 * <DT><B>script level</B>
 * <DD>Any code outside a procedure is referred to as script-level code.
 *
 * <DT><B>seed</B>
 * <DD>An initial value used to generate pseudorandom numbers.  For
 * example, the <b>Randomize</b> statement creates a seed number used by the
 * <b>Rnd</b> function to create unique pseudorandom number
 * sequences.
 *
 * <DT><B>string comparison</B>
 * <DD>A comparison of two sequences of characters.  Unless specified in
 * the function making the comparison, all string comparisons are binary.  In
 * English, binary comparisons are case-sensitive; text comparisons are
 * not.
 *
 * <DT><B>string expression</B>
 * <DD>Any expression that evaluates to a sequence of contiguous
 * characters.  Elements of a string expression can include a function that

 * during program execution.  Each variable has a name that uniquely
 * identifies it within its level of scope.<P>Variable names:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Must begin with an alphabetic character.
 * <LI>Can't contain an embedded period or type-declaration character.
 * <LI>Must be unique within the same scope.
 * <LI>Must be no longer than 255 characters.

/**
 * <P><B>Simple Validation</B>
 * <P>
 * You can use Visual Basic Scripting Edition to do much of the form
 * processing that you'd usually have to do on a server.  You can also do
 * things that just can't be done on the server.
 * <P>
 * Here's an example of simple client-side validation.  The HTML code
 * is for a text box and a button.  If you use Microsoft&#174; Internet
 * Explorer to view the page produced by the following code, you'll see a
 * small text box with a button next to it.
 *
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;HTML&gt;
 * &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Simple Validation&lt;/TITLE&gt;
 * &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;
 * &lt;!--
 * Sub Button1_OnClick
 *   Dim TheForm
 *   Set TheForm = Document.ValidForm
 *   If IsNumeric(TheForm.Text1.Value) Then
 *     If TheForm.Text1.Value &lt; 1 Or TheForm.Text1.Value &gt; 10 Then
 *       MsgBox "Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
 *     Else
 *       MsgBox "Thank you."
 *     End If
 *   Else
 *     MsgBox "Please enter a numeric value."
 *   End If
 * End Sub
 * --&gt;
 * &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
 * &lt;/HEAD&gt;
 * &lt;BODY&gt;
 * &lt;H3&gt;Simple Validation&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;HR&gt;
 * &lt;FORM NAME="ValidForm"&gt;
 * Enter a value between 1 and 10:
 * &lt;INPUT NAME="Text1" TYPE="TEXT" SIZE="2"&gt;
 * &lt;INPUT NAME="Button1" TYPE="BUTTON" VALUE="Submit"&gt;
 * &lt;/FORM&gt;
 * &lt;/BODY&gt;
 * &lt;/HTML&gt;
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * The difference between this text box and the examples on A Simple
 * VBScript Page is that the <B>Value</B> property of the text box is used to
 * check the entered value.  To get the <B>Value</B> property, the code has
 * to qualify the reference to the name of the text box.
 * <P>
 * You can always write out the full reference
 * <CODE>Document.ValidForm.Text1</CODE>.  However, where you have multiple
 * references to form controls, you'll want to do what was done here.  First
 * declare a variable.  Then use the {@link Set} statement to assign the form
 * to the variable <CODE>TheForm</CODE>.  A regular assignment statement,
 * such as {@link Dim}, doesn't work here; you must use <B>Set</B> to
 * preserve the reference to an object.
 *
 * <P><B>Using Numeric Values</B>
 * <P>
 * Notice that the example directly tests the value against a number: it
 * uses the {@link IsNumeric} function to make sure the string in the text
 * box is a number.  Although VBScript automatically converts strings and
 * numbers, it's always a good practice to test a user-entered value for its
 * data subtype and to use {@link Conversion_Functions} as necessary.  When
 * doing addition with text box values, convert the values explicitly to
 * numbers because the plus sign ({@link Plus "+"}) represents both addition
 * and string concatenation.  For example, if <CODE>Text1</CODE> contains "1"
 * and <CODE>Text2</CODE> contains "2", you see the following results:
 *
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>A = Text1.Value + Text2.Value          ' A is "12"
 * A = CDbl(Text1.Value) + Text2.Value     ' A is 3
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * <P><B>Validating and Passing Data Back to the Server</B>
 * <P>
 * The simple validation example uses a plain button control.  If a Submit
 * control was used, the example would never see the data to check
 * it&#151;everything would go immediately to the server.  Avoiding the
 * Submit control lets you check the data, but it doesn't submit the data to
 * the server.  That requires an additional line of code:
 *
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;
 * &lt;!--
 * Sub Button1_OnClick
 *   Dim TheForm
 *   Set TheForm = Document.ValidForm
 *   If IsNumeric(TheForm.Text1.Value) Then
 *     If TheForm.Text1.Value &lt; 1 Or TheForm.Text1.Value &gt; 10 Then
 *       MsgBox "Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
 *     Else
 *       MsgBox "Thank you."
 *       TheForm.Submit    ' Data correct; send to server.
 *     End If
 *   Else
 *     MsgBox "Please enter a numeric value."
 *   End If
 * End Sub
 * --&gt;
 * &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * To send the data to the server, the code invokes the <B>Submit</B>
 * method on the form object when the data is correct.  From there, the
 * server handles the data just as it otherwise would&#151;except that the
 * data is correct before it gets there.  You'll find complete information
 * about the <B>Submit</B> method and other methods on the Internet Explorer
 * Scripting Object Model page.
 * <P>
 * So far, you've seen only the standard HTML &lt;FORM&gt; objects.
 * Internet Explorer also lets you exploit the full power of ActiveX&#174;
 * controls (formerly called OLE controls) and Java&#153; objects.

/**
 * <P><B>What Are Coding Conventions?</B>
 * <P>
 * Coding conventions are suggestions that may help you write code using
 * Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition.  Coding conventions can include
 * the following:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Naming conventions for objects, variables, and procedures
 * <LI>Commenting conventions
 * <LI>Text formatting and indenting guidelines
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * The main reason for using a consistent set of coding conventions is to
 * standardize the structure and coding style of a script or set of scripts *
 * so that you and others can easily read and understand the code.  Using
 * good coding conventions results in precise, readable, and unambiguous
 * source code that is consistent with other language conventions and as
 * intuitive as possible.
 *
 * <P><B>Constant Naming Conventions</B>
 * <P>
 * Earlier versions of VBScript had no mechanism for creating user-defined
 * constants. Constants, if used, were implemented as variables and
 * distinguished from other variables using all uppercase characters.
 * Multiple words were separated using the underscore (_) character.
 * For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>USER_LIST_MAX
 * NEW_LINE
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * While this is still an acceptable way to indentify your constants, you
 * may want to use an alternative naming scheme, now that you can create true
 * constants using the {@link Const} statement. This convention uses a
 * mixed-case format in which constant names have a "con" prefix. For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>conYourOwnConstant
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * <P><B>Variable Naming Conventions</B>
 * <P>
 * For purposes of readability and consistency, use the following prefixes
 * with descriptive names for variables in your VBScript code.
 * <DL compact>
 * <DT><B>Subtype</B><DD style="marginleft:75pt"><B>Prefix</B> -- <B>Example</B>
 * <DT><B>Boolean</B><DD style="marginleft:75pt">bln -- blnFound

 * </DL>
 *
 * <P><B>Variable Scope</B>
 * <P>
 * Variables should always be defined with the smallest scope possible.
 * VBScript variables can have the following scope.<P>
 * <DL>
 * <DT><b>Procedure-level</B> -- Event, Function, or Sub procedure
 * <DD>Visible in the procedure in which it is declared
 * <DT><B>Script-level</B> -- HEAD section of  an HTML page, outside any procedure
 * <DD>Visible in every procedure in the script
 * </DL>
 *
 * <P><B>Variable Scope Prefixes</B>
 * <P>
 * As script size grows, so does the value of being able to quickly
 * differentiate the scope of variables.  A one-letter scope prefix preceding
 * the type prefix provides this, without unduly increasing the size of
 * variable names.
 * <DL compact>
 * <DT><B>Scope</B><DD style="marginleft:100pt"><B>Prefix</B> -- <B>Example</B>
 * <DT>Procedure-level<DD style="marginleft:100pt">None -- dblVelocity
 * <DT>Script-level<DD style="marginleft:100pt">s -- sblnCalcInProgress
 * </DL>
 *
 * <P><B>Descriptive Variable and Procedure Names</B>
 * <P>
 * The body of a variable or procedure name should use mixed case and
 * should be as complete as necessary to describe its purpose.  * In
 * addition, procedure names should begin with a verb, such as InitNameArray
 * or CloseDialog.
 * <P>
 * For frequently used or long terms, standard abbreviations are
 * recommended to help keep name length reasonable.  In general, variable
 * names greater than 32 characters can be difficult to read.  When using
 * abbreviations, make sure they are consistent throughout the entire script.
 * For example, randomly switching between Cnt and Count within a script or
 * set of scripts may lead to confusion.

 * </DL>
 *
 * <P><B>Code Commenting Conventions</B>
 * <P>
 * All procedures should begin with a brief comment describing what they
 * do.  This description should not describe the implementation details (how
 * it does it) because these often change over time, resulting in unnecessary
 * comment maintenance work, or worse, erroneous comments.  The code itself
 * and any necessary inline comments describe the implementation.
 * <P>
 * Arguments passed to a procedure should be described when their purpose is
 * not obvious and when the procedure expects the arguments to be in a
 * specific range.  Return values for functions and variables that are
 * changed by a procedure, especially through reference arguments, should
 * also be described at the beginning of each procedure.
 * <P>
 * Procedure header comments should include the following section headings.
 * For examples, see the "Formatting Your Code" section that follows.
 * <DL compact>
 * <DT><B>Section Heading</B>
 * <DD style="marginleft:100pt"><B>Comment Contents</B>

 * obvious. Each argument should be on a separate line with inline comments.
 * <DT>Return Values
 * <DD style="marginleft:100pt">Explanation of the value returned.
 * </DL>
 * Remember the following points:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Every important variable declaration should include an inline
 * comment describing the use of the variable being declared.
 * <LI>Variables, controls, and procedures should be named clearly enough
 * that inline comments are only needed for complex implementation details.
 * <LI>At the beginning of your script, you should include an overview that
 * describes the script, enumerating objects, procedures, algorithms, dialog
 * boxes, and other system dependencies.  Sometimes a piece of pseudocode
 * describing the algorithm can be helpful.

/**
 * <P><B>Controlling Program Execution</B>
 * <P>
 * You can control the flow of your script with conditional statements and
 * looping statements.  Using conditional statements, you can write VBScript
 * code that makes decisions and repeats actions.  The following conditional
 * statements are available in VBScript:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> {@link If          If...Then...Else} statement
 * <LI> {@link Select_Case Select Case} statement
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P><B>Making Decisions Using If...Then...Else</B>
 * <P>
 * The <B>If...Then...Else</B> statement is used to evaluate whether a
 * condition is <B>True</B> or <B>False</B> and, depending on the result,
 * to specify one or more statements to run.  Usually the condition is an
 * expression that uses a comparison operator to compare one value or
 * variable with another.  For information about comparison operators, see
 * {@link Comparison_Operators}.  <B>If...Then...Else</B> statements can
 * be nested to as many levels as you need.
 *
 * <P><B>Running Statements if a Condition is True</B>
 * <P>
 * To run only one statement when a condition is <B>True</B>, use the
 * single-line syntax for the <B>If...Then...Else</B> statement.  The
 * following example shows the single-line syntax.  Notice that this example
 * omits the <B>Else</B> keyword.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Sub FixDate()
 *      Dim myDate
 *      myDate = #2/13/95#
 *      If myDate &lt; Now Then myDate = Now
 * End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * To run more than one line of code, you must use the multiple-line (or
 * block) syntax.  This syntax includes the <B>End If</B> statement, as shown
 * in the following example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Sub AlertUser(value)
 *      If value = 0 Then
 *          AlertLabel.ForeColor = vbRed
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Bold = True
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Italic = True
 *      End If
 * End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * <P><B>Running Certain Statements if a Condition is True<BR>
 * and Running Others if a Condition is False </B>
 * <P>
 * You can use an <B>If...Then...Else</B> statement to define two blocks of
 * executable statements: one block to run if the condition is <B>True</B>,
 * the other block to run if the condition is <B>False</B>.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Sub AlertUser(value)
 *      If value = 0 Then
 *          AlertLabel.ForeColor = vbRed
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Bold = True
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Italic = True
 *      Else
 *          AlertLabel.Forecolor = vbBlack
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Bold = False
 *          AlertLabel.Font.Italic = False
 *      End If
 * End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * <P><B>Deciding Between Several Alternatives</B>
 * <P>
 * A variation on the <b>If...Then...Else</b> statement allows you to choose
 * from several alternatives. Adding <b>ElseIf</b> clauses expands the
 * functionality of the <b>If...Then...Else</b> statement so you can control
 * program flow based on different possibilities. For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub ReportValue(value)
 *      If value = 0 Then
 *          MsgBox value
 *      ElseIf value = 1 Then
 *          MsgBox value
 *      ElseIf value = 2 then
 *          Msgbox value
 *      Else
 *          Msgbox "Value out of range!"
 *      End If
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You can add as many <b>ElseIf</b> clauses as you need to provide
 * alternative choices.  Extensive use of the <b>ElseIf</b> clauses often
 * becomes cumbersome.  A better way to choose between several alternatives
 * is the <B>Select Case</B> statement.
 *
 * <P><B>Making Decisions with Select Case</B>
 * <P>
 * The <b>Select Case</b> structure provides an alternative to
 * <b>If...Then...ElseIf</b> for selectively executing one block of
 * statements from among multiple blocks of statements.  A <b>Select Case</b>
 * statement provides capability similar to the <b>If...Then...Else
 * statement</b>, but it makes code more efficient and readable.<p>
 *
 * A <b>Select Case</b> structure works with a single test expression that
 * is evaluated once, at the top of the structure.  The result of the
 * expression is then compared with the values for each <b>Case</b> in the
 * structure.  If there is a match, the block of statements associated with
 * that <b>Case</b> is executed:
 * <p>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Select Case Document.Form1.CardType.Options(SelectedIndex).Text
 *     Case "MasterCard"
 *         DisplayMCLogo
 *         ValidateMCAccount
 *     Case "Visa"
 *         DisplayVisaLogo
 *         ValidateVisaAccount
 *     Case "American Express"
 *         DisplayAMEXCOLogo
 *         ValidateAMEXCOAccount
 *     Case Else
 *         DisplayUnknownImage
 *         PromptAgain
 * End Select
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Notice that the <b>Select Case</b> structure evaluates an expression
 * once at the top of the structure.  In contrast, the
 * <b>If...Then...ElseIf</b> structure can evaluate a different expression
 * for each <b>ElseIf</b> statement.  You can replace an
 * <b>If...Then...ElseIf </b>structure with a <b>Select Case</b> structure
 * only if each <b>ElseIf</b> statement evaluates the same expression.

/**
 * A constant is a meaningful name that takes the place of a number or string
 * and never changes. VBScript defines a number of intrinsic constants. You
 * can get information about these intrinsic constants from the
 * {@link VBScript_Reference VBScript Language Reference}.
 *
 * <P><B>Creating Constants</B>
 * You create user-defined constants in VBScript using the {@link Const}
 * statement.  Using the <B>Const</B> statement, you can create string or
 * numeric constants with meaningful names and assign them literal values.
 * For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Const MyString = "This is my string."
 * Const MyAge = 49
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Note that the string literal is enclosed in quotation marks (" ").
 * Quotation marks are the most obvious way to differentiate string values
 * from numeric values.  Date literals and time literals are represented by
 * enclosing them in number signs (#).  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Const CutoffDate = #6-1-97#
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You may want to adopt a naming scheme to differentiate constants from
 * variables.  This will prevent you from trying to reassign constant values
 * while your script is running.  For example, you might want to use a "vb"
 * or "con" prefix on your constant names, or you might name your constants
 * in all capital letters.  Differentiating constants from variables
 * eliminates confusion as you develop more complex scripts.
 * <p>
 * Note: The intrinsic constants (below) are only available when your project
 * has an explicit reference to the appropriate type library containing these
 * constant definitions.  For VBScript, you must explicitly declare these
 * constants in your code.

/**
 * <P><B>What Are VBScript Data Types?</B>
 * <P>
 * VBScript has only one data type called a <B>Variant</B>.  A
 * <B>Variant</B> is a special kind of data type that can contain different
 * kinds of information, depending on how it's used.  Because <B>Variant</B>
 * is the only data type in VBScript, it's also the data type returned by all
 * functions in VBScript.
 * <P>
 * At its simplest, a <B>Variant</B> can contain either numeric or string
 * information.  A <B>Variant</B> behaves as a number when you use it in a
 * numeric context and as a string when you use it in a string context.  That
 * is, if you're working with data that looks like numbers, VBScript assumes
 * that it is numbers and does the thing that is most appropriate for
 * numbers.  Similarly, if you're working with data that can only be string
 * data, VBScript treats it as string data.  Of course, you can always make
 * numbers behave as strings by enclosing them in quotation marks (&quot;
 * &quot;).
 *
 * <P><B>Variant Subtypes</B>
 * <P>
 * Beyond the simple numeric or string classifications, a <B>Variant</B>
 * can make further distinctions about the specific nature of numeric
 * information.  For example, you can have numeric information that
 * represents a date or a time.  When used with other date or time data, the
 * result is always expressed as a date or a time.  Of course, you can also
 * have a rich variety of numeric information ranging in size from Boolean
 * values to huge floating-point numbers.  These different categories of
 * information that can be contained in a <B>Variant</B> are called subtypes.
 * Most of the time, you can just put the kind of data you want in a
 * <B>Variant</B>, and the <B>Variant</B> behaves in a way that is most
 * appropriate for the data it contains.
 * <P>
 * The following table shows the subtypes of data that a <B>Variant</B>
 * can contain.

 * The result is a little underwhelming: a dialog box displays a Latin
 * phrase ("Wonderful to behold").  However, there's quite a bit going on.
 * <P>
 * When Internet Explorer reads the page, it finds the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags,
 * recognizes there is a piece of VBScript code, and saves the code.  When
 * you click the button, Internet Explorer makes the connection between the
 * button and the code, and runs the procedure.
 * <P>
 * The <B>Sub</B> procedure in the &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags is an event
 * procedure.  There are two parts to the procedure name: the name of the
 * button, <CODE>Button1</CODE> (from the NAME attribute in the &lt;INPUT&gt;
 * tag), and an event name, <CODE>OnClick</CODE>.  The two names are joined
 * by an underscore(_).  Any time the button is clicked, Internet Explorer
 * looks for and runs the corresponding event procedure,
 * <CODE>Button1_OnClick</CODE>.
 * <P>
 * Internet Explorer defines the events available for form controls in the
 * Internet Explorer Scripting Object Model documentation.
 * <P>
 * Pages can use combinations of controls and procedures, too.  {@link
 * VBScript_Forms VBScript and Forms} shows some simple interactions between
 * controls.
 *
 * <P><B>Other Ways to Attach Code to Events</B>
 * <P>
 * Although the preceding way is probably the simplest and most general,
 * you can attach VBScript code to events in two other ways.
 * Internet Explorer allows you to add short sections of inline code in the
 * tag defining the control.  For example, the following &lt;INPUT&gt; tag
 * performs the same action as the previous code example when you click the
 * button:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;INPUT NAME="Button1" TYPE="BUTTON"
 *        VALUE="Click Here" OnClick='MsgBox "Mirabile visu."'&gt;
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Notice that the function call itself is enclosed in single quotation
 * marks, and the string for the <B>MsgBox</B> function is enclosed in double
 * quotation marks.  You can use multiple statements as long as you separate
 * the statements with colons (:).
 * <P>
 * You can also write a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag so that it applies only to a
 * particular event for a specific control:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript" EVENT="OnClick" FOR="Button1"&gt;
 * &lt;!--
 *     MsgBox "Mirabile visu."

 * <P>
 * One notable exception to this rule is that you may want to provide

 * <P><B>Using While...Wend</B>
 * <P>
 * The <B>While...Wend</B> statement is provided in VBScript for those who
 * are familiar with its usage.  However, because of the lack of flexibility
 * in <B>While...Wend</B>, it is recommended that you use <B>Do...Loop</B>
 * instead.
 *
 * <P><B>Using For...Next</B>
 * <P>
 * You can use <B>For...Next</B> statements to run a block of statements a
 * specific number of times.  For loops, use a counter variable whose value
 * is increased or decreased with each repetition of the loop.
 * <P>
 * For example, the following procedure causes a procedure called
 * <CODE>MyProc</CODE> to execute 50 times.  The <B>For</B> statement
 * specifies the counter variable x and its start and end values.  The
 * <B>Next</B> statement increments the counter variable by 1.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub DoMyProc50Times()
 *      Dim x
 *      For x = 1 To 50
 *          MyProc
 *      Next
 *  End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Using the <B>Step</B> keyword, you can increase or decrease the counter
 * variable by the value you specify.  In the following example, the counter
 * variable j is incremented by 2 each time the loop repeats.  When the loop
 * is finished, total is the sum of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub TwosTotal()
 *      Dim j, total
 *      For j = 2 To 10 Step 2
 *          total = total + j
 *      Next
 *      MsgBox "The total is " & total
 *  End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * To decrease the counter variable, you use a negative <B>Step</B> value.
 * You must specify an end value that is less than the start value.  In the
 * following example, the counter variable <CODE>myNum</CODE> is decreased by
 * 2 each time the loop repeats.  When the loop is finished, total is the sum
 * of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, and 2.<P>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub NewTotal()
 *      Dim myNum, total
 *      For myNum = 16 To 2 Step -2
 *          total = total + myNum
 *      Next
 *      MsgBox "The total is " & total
 *  End Sub
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You can exit any <B>For...Next</B> statement before the counter reaches
 * its end value by using the <B>Exit For</B> statement.  Because you usually
 * want to exit only in certain situations, such as when an error occurs, you
 * should use the <B>Exit For</B> statement in the <B>True</B> statement
 * block of an <B>If...Then...Else</B> statement.  If the condition is
 * <B>False</B>, the loop runs as usual.
 *
 * <P><B>Using For Each...Next</B>
 * <P>
 * A <b>For Each...Next</b> loop is similar to a <b>For...Next</b> loop.
 * Instead of repeating the statements a specified number of times, a <B>For
 * Each...Next</B> loop repeats a group of statements for each item in a
 * collection of objects or for each element of an array.  This is especially
 * helpful if you don't know how many elements are in a collection.
 * <p>
 * In the following HTML code example, the contents of a <B>Dictionary</B>
 * object is used to place text in several text boxes:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> &lt;HTML&gt;
 *  &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Forms and Elements&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;
 *  &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;

/**
 * <P><B>Using Objects</B>
 * <P>
 * Whether you use an ActiveX&#174; control (formerly called an OLE control)
 * or a Java&#153; object, Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition and
 * Microsoft&#174; Internet Explorer handle it the same way.  If you're using
 * Internet Explorer and have installed the controls available in the ActiveX
 * Gallery, you can see the page produced by the following code.  <P>You
 * include an object using the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags and set its initial
 * property values using &lt;PARAM&gt; tags.  If you're a Visual Basic
 * programmer, you'll recognize that using the &lt;PARAM&gt; tags is just
 * like setting initial properties for a control on a form.  For example, the
 * following set of &lt;OBJECT&gt; and &lt;PARAM&gt; tags adds the ActiveX
 * Label control to a page:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;OBJECT
 *         classid="clsid:99B42120-6EC7-11CF-A6C7-00AA00A47DD2"
 *         id=lblActiveLbl
 *         width=250
 *         height=250
 *         align=left
 *         hspace=20
 *         vspace=0
 * &gt;
 * &lt;PARAM NAME="Angle" VALUE="90"&gt;
 * &lt;PARAM NAME="Alignment" VALUE="4"&gt;

 * &lt;PARAM NAME="FontBold" VALUE="1"&gt;
 * &lt;PARAM NAME="FrColor" VALUE="0"&gt;
 * &lt;/OBJECT&gt;
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You can get properties, set properties, and invoke methods just as with
 * any of the form controls.  The following code, for example, includes
 * &lt;FORM&gt; controls you can use to manipulate two properties of the
 * Label control:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;FORM NAME="LabelControls"&gt;
 * &lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="txtNewText" SIZE=25&gt;
 * &lt;INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" NAME="cmdChangeIt" VALUE="Change Text"&gt;
 * &lt;INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" NAME="cmdRotate" VALUE="Rotate Label"&gt;
 * &lt;/FORM&gt;
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * With the form defined, an event procedure for the
 * <CODE>cmdChangeIt</CODE> button changes the label text:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;
 * &lt;!--
 * Sub cmdChangeIt_onClick
 *         Dim TheForm
 *         Set TheForm = Document.LabelControls
 *         lblActiveLbl.Caption = TheForm.txtNewText.Value
 * End Sub
 * --&gt;
 * &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * The code qualifies references to controls and values inside the forms
 * just as in the {@link Simple_Validation} example.
 * <P>
 * Several ActiveX controls are available from the ActiveX Gallery for use
 * with Internet Explorer.  You can find complete information about the
 * properties, methods, and events there, as well as the class identifiers
 * (CLSID) for the controls on the programming reference pages.  You can find
 * more information about the &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag on the Internet Explorer 4.0
 * Author's Guide and HTML Reference page.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier releases of Internet Explorer required
 * braces ({}) around the classid attribute and did not conform to the
 * <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Addressing/clsid-scheme" TARGET="_top">W3C

 * <P>
 * A <B>Sub</B> procedure is a series of VBScript statements, enclosed by
 * <B>Sub</B> and <B>End Sub</B> statements, that perform actions but don't
 * return a value. A <B>Sub</B> procedure can take arguments (constants,
 * variables, or expressions that are passed by a calling procedure). If a
 * <B>Sub</B> procedure has no arguments, its <B>Sub</B> statement must
 * include an empty set of parentheses ().
 * <P>
 * The following <B>Sub</B> procedure uses two intrinsic, or built-in,

 * user for some information. It then displays the results of a calculation
 * based on that information. The calculation is performed in a <B>Function</B>

 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub ConvertTemp()

 * <P><B>Function Procedures</B>
 * <P>
 * A <B>Function</B> procedure is a series of VBScript statements enclosed

 * <B>Variant</B>.
 * <P>
 * In the following example, the Celsius function calculates degrees Celsius
 * from degrees Fahrenheit.  When the function is called from the ConvertTemp
 * <B>Sub</B> procedure, a variable containing the argument value is passed
 * to the function. The result of the calculation is returned to the calling
 * procedure and displayed in a message box.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Sub ConvertTemp()

 *
 * <P><B>Getting Data into and out of Procedures</B>
 * <P>
 * Each piece of data is passed into your procedures using an argument.
 * Arguments serve as placeholders for the data you want to pass into your
 * procedure. You can name your arguments anything that is valid as a variable
 * name. When you create a procedure using either the <B>Sub</B> statement
 * or the <B>Function</B> statement, parentheses must be included after the
 * name of the procedure. Any arguments are placed inside these parentheses,
 * separated by commas. For example, in the following example,
 * <CODE>fDegrees</CODE> is a placeholder for the
 * value being passed into the Celsius function for conversion:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Function Celsius(fDegrees)
 *     Celsius = (fDegrees - 32) * 5 / 9
 *  End Function
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * To get data out of a procedure, you must use a <B>Function</B>.
 * Remember, a <B>Function</B> procedure can return a value; a <B>Sub</B>
 * procedure can't.
 * </BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P><B>Using <B>Sub</B> and <B>Function</B> Procedures in Code</B>
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 * A <B>Function</B> in your code must always be used on the right side

/**
 * <B>Simple Validation</B>
 * <P>You can use Visual Basic Scripting Edition to do much of the form processing that you'd usually have to do on a server. You can also do things that just can't be done on the server.
 * 
 * <P>Here's an example of simple client-side validation. The HTML code is for a text box and a button. If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer to view the page produced by the following code, you'll see a small text box with a button next to it.
 * 
 * <XMP>
 * 
 * <HTML>
 * <HEAD><TITLE>Simple Validation</TITLE>
 * <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript">
 * <!--
 * Sub Button1_OnClick
 *   Dim TheForm
 *   Set TheForm = Document.ValidForm
 *   If IsNumeric(TheForm.Text1.Value) Then
 *     If TheForm.Text1.Value < 1 Or TheForm.Text1.Value > 10 Then
 *       MsgBox "Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
 *     Else
 *       MsgBox "Thank you."
 *     End If
 *   Else
 *     MsgBox "Please enter a numeric value."
 *   End If
 * End Sub
 * -->
 * </SCRIPT>
 * </HEAD>
 * <BODY>
 * <H3>Simple Validation</H3><HR>
 * <FORM NAME="ValidForm">
 * Enter a value between 1 and 10:
 * <INPUT NAME="Text1" TYPE="TEXT" SIZE="2">
 * <INPUT NAME="Button1" TYPE="BUTTON" VALUE="Submit">
 * </FORM>
 * </BODY>
 * </HTML>
 * </xmp>
 * 
 * The difference between this text box and the examples on A Simple VBScript Page is that the Value property of the text box is used to check the entered value. To get the Value property, the code has to qualify the reference to the name of the text box.
 * <P>You can always write out the full reference Document.ValidForm.Text1. However, where you have multiple references to form controls, you'll want to do what was done here. First declare a variable. Then use the Set statement to assign the form to the variable TheForm. A regular assignment statement, such as Dim, doesn't work here; you must use Set to preserve the reference to an object.
 * 
 * <P><B>Using Numeric Values</B>
 * <P>Notice that the example directly tests the value against a number: it uses the IsNumeric function to make sure the string in the text box is a number. Although VBScript automatically converts strings and numbers, it's always a good practice to test a user-entered value for its data subtype and to use conversion functions as necessary. When doing addition with text box values, convert the values explicitly to numbers because the plus sign (+) operator represents both addition and string concatenation. For example, if Text1 contains "1" and Text2 contains "2", you see the following results:
 * <PRE>
 * A = Text1.Value + Text2.Value    ' A is "12"
 * A = CDbl(Text1.Value) + Text2.Value ' A is 3
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * 
 * <P><B>Validating and Passing Data Back to the Server</B>
 * <P>The simple validation example uses a plain button control. If a Submit control was used, the example would never see the data to check iteverything would go immediately to the server. Avoiding the Submit control lets you check the data, but it doesn't submit the data to the server. That requires an additional line of code:
 * <XMP>
 * <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript">
 * <!--
 * Sub Button1_OnClick
 *   Dim TheForm
 *   Set TheForm = Document.ValidForm
 *   If IsNumeric(TheForm.Text1.Value) Then
 *     If TheForm.Text1.Value < 1 Or TheForm.Text1.Value > 10 Then
 *       MsgBox "Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
 *     Else
 *       MsgBox "Thank you."
 *       TheForm.Submit ' Data correct; send to server.
 *     End If
 *   Else
 *     MsgBox "Please enter a numeric value."
 *   End If
 * End Sub
 * -->
 * </SCRIPT>
 * </xmp>
 * To send the data to the server, the code
 * invokes the Submit method on the form object

/**
 * <P><B>What Is a Variable?</B>
 * <P>
 * A variable is a convenient placeholder that refers to a computer memory
 * location where you can store program information that may change during
 * the time your script is running.  For example, you might create a variable
 * called <CODE>ClickCount</CODE> to store the number of times a user clicks
 * an object on a particular Web page.  Where the variable is stored in
 * computer memory is unimportant.  What's important is that you only have to
 * refer to a variable by name to see its value or to change its value.  In
 * VBScript, variables are always of one fundamental data type, {@link
 * Variant}.
 *
 * <P><B>Declaring Variables</B>
 * <P>
 * You declare variables explicitly in your script using the {@link Dim}
 * statement, the {@link Public} statement, and the {@link Private}
 * statement.  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Dim DegreesFahrenheit</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You declare multiple variables by separating each variable name with a comma.
 * For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Dim Top, Bottom, Left, Right
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * You can also declare a variable implicitly by simply using its name in
 * your script.  That's not generally a good practice because you could
 * misspell the variable name in one or more places, causing unexpected
 * results when your script is run.  For that reason, the {@link
 * Option_Explicit} statement is available to require explicit declaration of
 * all variables.  The <B>Option Explicit</B> statement should be the first
 * statement in your script.
 *
 * <P><B>Naming Restrictions</B>
 * <P>

 * Variable names follow the standard rules for naming anything in VBScript.
 * A variable name:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Must begin with an alphabetic character.
 * <LI>Cannot contain an embedded period.
 * <LI>Must not exceed 255 characters.
 * <LI>Must be unique in the scope in which it is declared.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P><B>Scope and Lifetime of Variables</B>
 * <P>
 * A variable's scope is determined by where you declare it.  When you
 * declare a variable within a procedure, only code within that procedure can
 * access or change the value of that variable.  It has local script-level
 * variable, and it has script-level scope.<P>
 *
 * How long a variable exists is its lifetime.  The lifetime of a
 * script-level variable extends from the time it's declared until the time
 * the script is finished running.  At procedure level, a variable exists
 * only as long as you are in the procedure.  When the procedure exits, the
 * variable is destroyed.  Local variables are ideal as temporary storage
 * space when a procedure is executing.  You can have local variables of the
 * same name in several different procedures because each is recognized only
 * by the procedure in which it is declared.
 *
 * <P><B>Assigning Values to Variables</B>
 * <P>
 * Values are assigned to variables creating an expression as follows: the
 * variable is on the left side of the expression and the value you want to
 * assign to the variable is on the right.  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> B = 200</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * <P><B>Scalar Variables and Array Variables</B>
 * <P>
 * Much of the time, you just want to assign a single value to a variable
 * you've declared.  A variable containing a single value is a scalar
 * variable.  Other times, it's convenient to assign more than one related
 * value to a single variable.  Then you can create a variable that can
 * contain a series of values.  This is called an array variable.  Array
 * variables and scalar variables are declared in the same way, except that
 * the declaration of an array variable uses parentheses ( ) following the
 * variable name.  In the following example, a single-dimension array
 * containing 11 elements is declared:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Dim A(10)</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Although the number shown in the parentheses is 10, all arrays in
 * VBScript are zero-based, so this array actually contains 11 elements.  In
 * a zero-based array, the number of array elements is always the number
 * shown in parentheses plus one.  This kind of array is called a fixed-size
 * array.
 * <P>
 * You assign data to each of the elements of the array using an index into
 * the array.  Beginning at zero and ending at 10, data can be assigned to
 * the elements of an array as follows:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> A(0) = 256
 *  A(1) = 324
 *  A(2) = 100
 *  . . .
 *  A(10) = 55
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * Similarly, the data can be retrieved from any element using an index
 * into the particular array element you want.  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> . . .
 *  SomeVariable = A(8)
 *  . . .
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * Arrays aren't limited to a single dimension.  You can have as many as 60
 * dimensions, although most people can't comprehend more than three or four
 * dimensions.  Multiple dimensions are declared by separating an array's
 * size numbers in the parentheses with commas.  In the following example,
 * the <CODE>MyTable</CODE> variable is a two-dimensional array consisting of
 * 6 rows and 11 columns:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Dim MyTable(5, 10)
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * In a two-dimensional array, the first number is always the number of
 * rows; the second number is the number of columns.
 * <P>
 * You can also declare an array whose size changes during the time your
 * script is running.  This is called a dynamic array.  The array is
 * initially declared within a procedure using either the <B>Dim</B>
 * statement or using the {@link ReDim} statement.  However, for a dynamic
 * array, no size or number of dimensions is placed inside the parentheses.
 * For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> Dim MyArray()
 *  ReDim AnotherArray()</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * To use a dynamic array, you must subsequently use <B>ReDim</B> to
 * determine the number of dimensions and the size of each dmension.  In the
 * following example, <B>ReDim </B> sets the initial size of the dynamic
 * array to 25.  A subsequent <B>ReDim</B> statement resizes the array to 30,
 * but uses the <B>Preserve</B> keyword to preserve the contents of the array
 * as the resizing takes place.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE> ReDim MyArray(25)
 *  . . .
 *  ReDim Preserve MyArray(30)</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * There is no limit to the number of times you can resize a dynamic array,
 * but you should know that if you make an array smaller than it was, you
 * lose the data in the eliminated elements.

 * Information Server.
 * <P><B>Easy to Use and Learn</B>
 * If you already know Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications,

 * from Microsoft Press.
 * <P><B>ActiveX Scripting</B>
 * VBScript talks to host applications using ActiveX&#174; Scripting.  With
 * ActiveX Scripting, browsers and other host applications don't require
 * special integration code for each scripting component.  ActiveX Scripting
 * enables a host to compile scripts, obtain and call entry points, and
 * manage the namespace available to the developer.  With ActiveX Scripting,
 * language vendors can create standard language run times for scripting.
 * Microsoft will provide run-time support for VBScript.  Microsoft is
 * working with various Internet groups to define the ActiveX Scripting
 * standard so that scripting engines can be interchangeable.  ActiveX
 * Scripting is used in Microsoft&#174; Internet Explorer and in
 * Microsoft&#174; Internet Information Server.
 * <P><B>VBScript in Other Applications and Browsers</B>
 * As a developer, you can license VBScript source implementation at no

 * implementations of VBScript for the 32-bit Windows&#174; API, the 16-bit
 * Windows API, and the Macintosh&#174;.  VBScript is integrated with World

    *  
    * <li><b>\v</b> -- Matches a vertical tab character.

    * two consecutive identical characters.
    *  
    * <li><b>\n</b> -- Matches n, where n is an octal escape value.  Octal
    * escape values must be 1, 2, or 3 digits long.  For example, "\11"
    * and "\011" both match a tab character.  "\0011" is the equivalent of
    * "\001" & "1".  Octal escape values must not exceed 256.  If they do,

 * Use the <b>GetObject</b> function to access an Automation object from a

 * variable.  For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Dim CADObject
 * Set CADObject = GetObject("C:\CAD\SCHEMA.CAD")
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * When this code is executed, the application associated with the
 * specified pathname is started and the object in the specified file is
 * activated.  If <I>pathname</I> is a zero-length string (""),
 * <b>GetObject</b> returns a new object instance of the specified type.  If
 * the <I>pathname</I> argument is omitted, <b>GetObject</b> returns a
 * currently active object of the specified type.  If no object of the
 * specified type exists, an error occurs.
 * <P>
 * Some applications allow you to activate part of a file.  Add an
 * exclamation point (!) to the end of the file name and follow it with a
 * string that identifies the part of the file you want to activate.  For
 * information on how to create this string, see the documentation for the
 * application that created the object.
 * <P>
 * For example, in a drawing application you might have multiple layers to
 * a drawing stored in a file.  You could use the following code to activate
 * a layer within a drawing called <CODE>SCHEMA.CAD</CODE>:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Set LayerObject = GetObject("C:\CAD\SCHEMA.CAD!Layer3")
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * If you don't specify the object's class, Automation determines the
 * application to start and the object to activate, based on the file name
 * you provide.  Some files, however, may support more than one class of
 * object.  For example, a drawing might support three different types of
 * objects: an Application object, a Drawing object, and a Toolbar object,
 * all of which are part of the same file.  To specify which object in a file
 * you want to activate, use the optional <I>class</I> argument.
 * For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><pre>Dim MyObject
 * Set MyObject = GetObject("C:\DRAWINGS\SAMPLE.DRW", "FIGMENT.DRAWING")
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * In the preceding example, <CODE>FIGMENT</CODE> is the
 * name of a drawing application and <CODE>DRAWING</CODE>
 * is one of the object types it supports. Once an object is activated, you
 * reference it in code using the object variable you defined. In the preceding
 * example, you access properties and methods of the new object using the object
 * variable <CODE>MyObject</CODE>. For example:
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><pre>MyObject.Line 9, 90
 * MyObject.InsertText 9, 100, "Hello, world."
 * MyObject.SaveAs "C:\DRAWINGS\SAMPLE.DRW"
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * <P>
 * <b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the <b>GetObject</b> function when there is a
 * current instance of the object or if you want to create the object with a
 * file already loaded.  If there is no current instance, and you don't want
 * the object started with a file loaded, use the <b>CreateObject</b>
 * function.</P> If an object has registered itself as a single-instance
 * object, only one instance of the object is created, no matter how many
 * times <b>CreateObject</b> is executed.  With a single-instance object,

 * <DT>{@link Arithmetic_Operators}
 * <DD style="marginleft:100pt">Operators used to perform mathematical calculations.

 * <P><B>Operator Precedence</B>
 * When several operations occur in an expression, each part is evaluated and resolved in a
 * predetermined order called operator precedence. You can use parentheses to override the
 * order of precedence and force some parts of an expression to be evaluated before others.
 * Operations within parentheses are always performed before those outside. Within parentheses,
 * however, standard operator precedence is maintained.
 * <P>
 * When expressions contain operators from more than one category, arithmetic operators are
 * evaluated first, comparison operators are evaluated next, and logical operators are evaluated
 * last. Comparison operators all have equal precedence; that is, they are evaluated in the
 * left-to-right order in which they appear. Arithmetic and logical operators are evaluated
 * in the following order of precedence.

 * When multiplication and division occur together in an expression, each

 * addition and subtraction occur together in an expression, each operation
 * is evaluated in order of appearance from left to right.
 * <P>
 * The string concatenation operator (<b>&amp;</b>) is not an arithmetic
 * operator, but in precedence it does fall after all arithmetic operators
 * and before all comparison operators.  The <b>Is</b> operator is an object
 * reference comparison operator.  It does not compare objects or their

 *
 * If not explicitly specified using either <B>Public</B> or <B>Private</B>, <b>Function</b> procedures are public by default, that is, they are visible to all other procedures in your script. The value of local variables in a <B>Function</B> is not preserved between calls to the procedure.<P>
 * All executable code must be contained in procedures. You can't define a <b>Function</b> procedure inside another <b>Function</b> or <b>Sub </b>procedure.<P>
 * The <b>Exit Function </b>statement causes an immediate exit from a <b>Function</b> procedure. Program execution continues with the statement following the statement that called the <b>Function</b> procedure. Any number of <b>Exit Function</b> statements can appear anywhere in a <b>Function</b> procedure.<P>Like a <b>Sub</b> procedure, a <b>Function</b> procedure is a separate procedure that can take arguments, perform a series of statements, and change the values of its arguments. However, unlike a <b>Sub</b> procedure, you can use a <b>Function</b> procedure on the right side of an expression in the same way you use any intrinsic function, such as <b>Sqr</b>, <b>Cos</b>, or <b>Chr</b>, when you want to use the value returned by the function.<P>
 * You call a <b>Function</b> procedure using the function name, followed by the argument list in parentheses, in an expression. See the <b>Call</b> statement for specific information on how to call <b>Function</b> procedures.<P>

 * <b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Function</b> procedures can be recursive; that is, they can call themselves to perform a given task. However, recursion can lead to stack overflow.

 * To return a value from a function, assign the value to the function name. Any number of such assignments can appear anywhere within the procedure. If no value is assigned to <i>name</i>, the procedure returns a default value: a numeric function returns 0 and a string function returns a zero-length string (&quot;&quot;). A function that returns an object reference returns <b>Nothing</b> if no object reference is assigned to <i>name</i> (using <b>Set</b>) within the <b>Function</b>.<P>
 *
 * @example
 * The following example shows how to assign a return value to a function named BinarySearch. In this case, <b>False</b> is assigned to the name to indicate that some value was not found.
 * <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Function BinarySearch(. . .)
 *     <b>. . .</b>
 *     ' Value not found. Return a value of False.
 *     If lower &gt; upper Then
 *         BinarySearch = False
 *         Exit Function
 *     End If
 *     <b>. . .</b>
 * End Function
 * </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 * Variables used in <b>Function</b> procedures fall into two categories: those that are explicitly declared within the procedure and those that are not. Variables that are explicitly declared in a procedure (using <b>Dim</b> or the equivalent) are always local to the procedure. Variables that are used but not explicitly declared in a procedure are also local unless they are explicitly declared at some higher level outside the procedure.<P>
 * <P>
 * <b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A procedure can use a variable that is not explicitly declared in the procedure, but a naming conflict can occur if anything you have defined at the script level has the same name. If your procedure refers to an undeclared variable that has the same name as another procedure, constant, or variable, it is assumed that your procedure is referring to that script-level name. Explicitly declare variables to avoid this kind of conflict. You can use an <b>Option Explicit</b> statement to force explicit declaration of variables.
 * <P>
 * <b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;VBScript may rearrange arithmetic expressions to increase internal efficiency. Avoid using a <b>Function</b> procedure in an arithmetic expression when the function changes the value of variables in the same expression.

 * <P>
 * To be valid, <i>objectvar</i> must be an object type consistent with the
 * object being assigned to it.
 * <P>
 * The <b>Dim</b>, <b>Private</b>, <b>Public</b>, or <b>ReDim</b>
 * statements only declare a variable that refers to an object.  No actual
 * object is referred to until you use the <b>Set</b> statement to assign a
 * specific object.
 * <P>
 * Generally, when you use <b>Set</b> to assign an object reference to a
 * variable, no copy of the object is created for that variable.  Instead, a
 * reference to the object is created.  More than one object variable can
 * refer to the same object.  Because these variables are references to
 * (rather than copies of) the object, any change in the object is reflected
 * in all variables that refer to it.<p>
 *
 * @param objectvar          Name of the variable or property; follows
 *                           standard variable naming conventions.
 * @param objectexpression   Expression consisting of the name of an object,
 *                           another declared variable of the same object type,
 *                           or a function or method that returns an object
 *                           of the same object type.
 * @param Nothing            Discontinues association of <i>objectvar</i>
 *                           with any specific object. Assigning <i>objectvar</i>
 *                           to <b>Nothing</b> releases all the system and memory
 *                           resources associated with the previously referenced
 *                           object when no other variable refers to it.

 * <P>
 * If not explicitly specified using either <B>Public</B> or
 * <B>Private</B>, * <b>Sub</b> procedures are public by default, that is,
 * they are visible to all other procedures in your script.  The value of
 * local variables in a <B>Sub</B> procedure is not preserved between calls
 * to the procedure.
 * <P>
 * All executable code must be contained in procedures.  You can't define a
 * <b>Sub</b> procedure inside another <b>Sub</b> or <b>Function</b>
 * procedure.
 * <P>
 * The <b>Exit Sub </b>statement causes an immediate exit from a <b>Sub</b>
 * procedure.  Program execution continues with the statement following the
 * statement that called the <b>Sub</b> procedure.  Any number of <b>Exit
 * Sub</b> statements can appear anywhere in a <b>Sub</b> procedure.
 * <P>
 * Like a <b>Function</b> procedure, a <b>Sub</b> procedure is a separate
 * procedure that can take arguments, perform a series of statements, and
 * change the value of its arguments.  However, unlike a <b>Function</b>
 * procedure, which returns a value, a <b>Sub</b> procedure can't be used in
 * an expression.
 * <P>
 * You call a <b>Sub</b> procedure using the procedure name followed by the
 * argument list.  See the <b>Call</b> statement for specific information on
 * how to call <b>Sub</b> procedures.
 * <P>
 * <b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sub</b> procedures can be recursive; that
 * is, they can call themselves to perform a given task.  However, recursion
 * can lead to stack overflow.  Static</b> keyword usually is not used with
 * recursive <b>Sub</b> procedures.
 * <P>
 * Variables used in <b>Sub</b> procedures fall into two categories: those
 * that are explicitly declared within the procedure and those that are not.
 * Variables that are explicitly declared in a procedure (using <b>Dim</b> or
 * the equivalent) are always local to the procedure.  Variables that are
 * used but not explicitly declared in a procedure are also local unless they
 * are explicitly declared at some higher level outside the procedure.
 * <P>
 * <b>Caution</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A procedure can use a variable that is not
 * explicitly declared in the procedure, but a naming conflict can occur if
 * anything you have defined at the constant or variable, it is assumed that
 * your procedure is referring to that script-level name.  Explicitly declare
 * variables to avoid this kind of conflict.  You can use an <b>Option
 * Explicit</b> statement to force explicit declaration of variables.
 *
 * @param Public       Indicates that the <b>Sub</b> procedure is accessible to
 *                     all other procedures in all scripts.
 * @param Private      Indicates that the <b>Sub</b> procedure is accessible only
 *                     to other procedures in the script where it is declared.
 * @param Static       Indicates that the <b>Sub</b> procedure's local variables
 *                     are preserved between calls.  The <b>Static</b> attribute
 *                     doesn't affect variables that are declared outside the
 *                     <b>Sub</b>, even if they are used in the procedure.</
 * @param name         Name of the <b>Sub</b>; follows standard variable naming conventions.
 * @param arglist      List of variables representing arguments that are
 *                     passed to the <b>Sub</b> procedure when it is called.
 *                     Multiple variables are separated by commas.
