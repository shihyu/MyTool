<p><a name="orig_notes"><h3>Original Release Notes for SlickEdit 2013 (18.0.0)</h3></a>
<ul>
    <li><b>New MDI Architecture</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The MDI layout has been completely rewritten to support multiple groups of document tabs</li>
        <li>Document tabs (and groups of tabs) can be floated as separate top-level windows, allowing better use of multiple monitors</li>
        <li>Files can be dragged and dropped to move between tab groups or to create new groups</li>
        <li>Resizing the outer MDI window automatically resizes the document tab edit windows. This ensures you utilize all the available space in the MDI area.</li>
        <li>The new document tabs offer much better performance than the previous File Tabs tool window, better supporting users who prefer to keep many files open</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Version Control</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A new Repository Browser dialog displays a summary of a repository's comment log history. Use the <i>Tools > Version Control > Browse Repository...</i> menu to bring up the dialog</li>
        <li>A new History Diff dialog allows you to quickly see side-by-side historical revision differences. This is supported for Subversion, Perforce, Mercurial, Git, and Backup History.
            Use the <i>Tools > Version Control > History Diff on...</i> menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Language Support</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for Matlab, CoffeeScript, Markdown, Google Go, and TTCN-3 has been added</li>
        <li>Tagging and source navigation of CSS is improved</li>
        <li>Color coding support for the Cg shader language has been added</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Beautifier Enhancements</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Java and C# are now supported in the new beautifier framework.</li>
        <li>New options have been added to support beautification for JavaDoc, Doxygen, and XMLDoc comments.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Project Support and Debugging</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Updated builds of GDB 7.5 (with Python pretty-printing support) are now distributed under the SlickEdit installation directory</li>
        <li>Variables now appear in declarative order in the  Debug Autos, Locals, and Members tool windows </li>
        <li>Setting breakpoints in C++ template classes is now more reliable when debugging with GDB</li>
        <li>Android Projects now support NDK development and debugging</li>
        <li>Unity projects with the .unityproj extension can now be opened directly in SlickEdit</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Large File Editing</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading and saving files greater than 2GB is now supported. In theory the maximum limit is 2TB, but 
            available system memory and hard drive speed are now the limiting factors. For substantially better performance,
            use an SSD.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>General</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced special character display: Unicode files now have a separate configuration section to specify how special character 
            sequences are displayed. Multi-character substitutions are supported.</li>
        <li>Vi/Vim emulation has been re-tooled internally to inherit base functionality from the CUA emulation. The behavior of Vi/Vim-specific key bindings
            is not affected, but more CUA commands are now available when in Insert Mode</li>
        <li>Added a new <i>File > Reload with Encoding</i> menu item which enables you to quickly reload an open file with a new encoding.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Use of the Komodo IDE Perl Remote Debugging Component.</h4>
<p>The Komodo IDE Perl Remote Debugging Component is covered by the Perl Artistic License:</p>
<b>Preamble</b>
<P>
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.
</P>
<b>Definitions</b>
<P>

	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
	created through textual modification.
</P>

<P>
	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
</P>

<P>
	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
	copyrights for the package.
</P>

<P>
	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
	this Package.
</P>

<P>
	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
	as a market that must bear the fee.)
</P>

<P>
	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
	under the same conditions they received it.
</P>

<OL>
    <LI>You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
    Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
    duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</LI>
    <LI>You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
    derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
    modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</LI>
    <LI>You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
    that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
    when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
    following:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

    <LI>place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</LI>

    <LI>use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</LI>

    <LI>rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</LI>

    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</LI>

</OL>
    <LI>You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
    executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</LI>
<OL TYPE="a">

    <LI>distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.</LI>

    <LI>accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.</LI>

    <LI>give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</LI>

    <LI>make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</LI>

</OL>

<LI>You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
interpreter is so embedded.</LI>

<LI>The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.</LI>

<LI>C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
regression tests for the language.</LI>

<LI>Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
construed as a distribution of this Package.</LI>

<LI>The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</LI>

<LI> THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</LI>
